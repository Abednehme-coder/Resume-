    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>If you asked me why I chose computer engineering back in the day, I would have told you that I found it interesting.
        <br> But now i look to it as a lifestyle, I feel lucky to have discovered  what makes me happy early on in life. 
        <br> There’s an underrated thrill in being curious and embracing every possible path along this journey—a feeling that perfectly sums up my interests in the digital world. 
        <br>But the thing that caught my attention from the start is Ai, and i honestly want to benifit from the Ai myself.  Just as my professors taught me how to code, helped me choose the best algorithms, and explained why they work, I want to teach AI in a similar fashion, 
        <br>and not just let it data consume everything on the web. Looking at how complicated can these modules think about a single thing is interesting to me and i want to invest in that.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>beside that here's some of the things i seem to like right now:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>coding.</li>
        <li>weightlifting And sports in general.</li>
        <li>consuming general knwoledge from documentaries and movies ,(this gives me a huge social psuh since it enables me to communicate with people form outside my domain).</li>
        <li>Gaming.</li>
        <li>scouts.</li>
        <li>if you ever came accross the term "pipelining", i am obessed with it.</li>
    </ul>
