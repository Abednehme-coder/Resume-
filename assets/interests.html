    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>If you had asked me why I chose computer engineering back in the day, I would have told you it was because I found it interesting.
        <br> But now, I see it as a lifestyle. I feel lucky to have discovered what makes me happy early on in life. 
        <br> There’s an underrated thrill in being curious and embracing every possible path along this journey—a feeling that perfectly sums up my interests in the digital world. 
        <br>But the thing that initially caught my attention was AI, and I honestly want to benefit from AI myself. Just as my professors taught me how to code, helped me choose the best algorithms, and explained why they work, I want to teach AI in a similar fashion, 
        <br>not just let it consume all the data on the web. Looking at how these complex modules think about a single problem is fascinating to me, and I want to invest in that.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Besides that, here are some of the things I enjoy right now:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Coding.</li>
        <li>Weightlifting and sports in general.</li>
        <li>Consuming general knowledge from documentaries and movies (this gives me a huge social push, as it enables me to communicate with people from outside my domain).</li>
        <li>Gaming.</li>
        <li>Scouts.</li>
        <li>If you’ve ever come across the term "pipelining," I’m obsessed with it.</li>
    </ul>
